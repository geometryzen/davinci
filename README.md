# Welcome to DaVinci

DaVinci is a Python to JavaScript cross-compiler.

The primary purpose is to allow Python to be run in a browser using the JavaScript engine to support Mathematical Physics, Engineering, and Computer Graphics applications.

It is being used by [GeometryZen](http://www.geometryzen.org).

## Origins

DaVinci is a fork of the Skulpt project.
DaVinci provides Mathematical Physics and Computer Graphics extensions to Skulpt.

Skulpt is the brainchild of Scott Graham.  See [skulpt.org](http://skulpt.org) for some early demos of Skulpt in action.

Brad Miller has been shepherding the development of Skulpt since sometime in 2010/2011.

DaVinci was created by David Holmes in early 2013.

## How can I help?

There is plenty of work still to do in making improvements to DaVinci.  If you would like to contribute

1. Create a Github account if you don't already have one
2. Create a Fork of the davinci repository -- This will make a clone of the repository in your account. **DO NOT** clone this one.
3. Once you've made the fork you will clone the forked version in your account to your local machine for development.
4. Check the issues list for something to do.
5. Fix or add your own features.  Commit and push to your forked version of the repository.
   When everything is tested and ready to be incorporated into the master version...
6. Make a Pull Request to get your feature(s) added to the main repository.
