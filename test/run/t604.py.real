a => 3*i+5*j+7*k
b => 2*i+4*j+6*k
a cross b => 2*i-4*j+2*k
1) a cross b is orthogonal to both b and c.
(a cross b).dot(a) => 0.0
(a cross b).dot(b) => 0.0
2) |a cross b| = |a||b|sin(theta), where theta is the angle between a and b.
3) The direction of a cross b follows the right-hand rule.
i cross j => k
j cross k => i
k cross i => j
j cross i => -k
k cross j => -i
i cross k => -j
i, j and k are actually multivectors under the covers!
repr(i) => Vector3(1, 0, 0)
repr(j) => Vector3(0, 1, 0)
repr(k) => Vector3(0, 0, 1)
Pseudoscalar3(1) => I
repr(Pseudoscalar3(1)) => Pseudoscalar3(1)

dual(b) => -6*ij-2*jk-4*ki
repr(dual(b)) => Bivector3(-6, -2, -4)
a << dual(b) => 2*i-4*j+2*k
a cross b    => 2*i-4*j+2*k
